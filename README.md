How getting to the rim plays into guard's success in the NBA 

With the advance of player tracking, many NBA teams are turning towards analytics for in-game offense and defense selection. One area where this is particularly evident is shot selection. In an effort to boost shot efficiency some teams like the Houston Rockets are clustering shots either close to the rim or from three-point range.

More specifically, are drive attempt metrics a good indicator that points guards and shooting guards will a generate a value above replacement (VORP) greater than zero? For reference, VORP is a statistic that measures NBA players' overall offensive and defensive impact on the court, which can be either positive or negative. In 2017-18, the average VORP was 0.46.

To test our initial question, we built a logistic regression model measuring whether the point guard or shooting guard had a VORP above or below zero (as a binary 0,1 variable) based on the percent field goal attempts, free throw attempts, points, and assists on drives as well as drive attempts per minute.
